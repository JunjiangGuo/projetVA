# Deployment of a wireless sensor network for concrete health monitoring

# Priorities:
# Design an end-to-end wireless sensors network for monitoring health of reinforced concrete and the structure, with strong constraints: 
- [Innovative on-board transducers and measurement techniques]
Sensors that can communicate with a centralised device which acts as a gateway
Limited energy and computing capacity resources
Targeted long service life without maintenance
Wireless Energy Harvesting
